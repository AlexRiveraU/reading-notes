# OSS Contributions

### What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

1. **Improve Coding -** Not only good for practice programming skills, but to also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. 
2. **Gain Early Experience -** Become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding code into the main repository. 
3. **Increase Community and Peer Recognition -** Recognition from members of the OSS community can be encouraging and motivating to continue improving our skills and to create new opportunities.
4. **Greater Job Prospects -** It can also improve our job and career prospects.
5. **Improve Software on a User and Business Level -** Contributing can also resonate on a business level. If a company is using an open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features, could potentially turn into a good opportunity for us.
