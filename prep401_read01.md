# Data Structures and Algorithms

This topic matters as it relates to introducing Data Structures and Algorithms, which is an essential part to be able to pass a job interview.

## Discussion Questions

* **What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

One important thing to consider when deciding which DS to use is to measure its algorithmic efficiency using BigO notation, this will help us determine how well an operation scales to solve our particular problem.

* **How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

Recursion is when a function calls itself. In order to avoid infinite recursion we must specify a base case. It tells our function when to stop running.

### Things I want to know more about

* I would like to learn more about DSA, understand better the different types of Data Structures and learn how to practice BigO notation.
