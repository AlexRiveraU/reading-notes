# Linked Lists

## Vocabulary / Definition List

 

* **Data structures -** Specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.

* **Linear data structures -** Data structures where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent.

* **Non-Linear data structures -** Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly.

* **Static data structures -** Data structures that need all of their resources to be allocated in memory in one contiguous block when they’re created. They always need a given size and amount of memory.

* **Dynamic data structures -** Data structures that don’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist. They can shrink and grow in memory. Their size, shape and the amount of memory needed can change.

* **Linked List -** Data structure that contains a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other and point to the next node in the list.

* **Nodes -** The individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

* **Next -** Property that contains the reference to the next node.

* **Head -** Reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

* **Tail -** Reference of type Node to the last node in a linked list.

* **Current -** Reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

* **Singly Linked Lists -** There is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node. They only go in one direction. 

* **Doubly Linked Lists -** There are two references within the node. One points to the Next Node and the other to the Previous node.

* **Circular Linked list -** The first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list.

* **BigO Notation -** Describes the efficiency of an algorithm or function using algebraic terms.

* **Running Time -** The amount of time a function needs to complete.

* **Memory Space -** The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
