## CSS LAYOUT

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, block-Level or inline-Level. It has the following positioning schemes to control the layout:

* **Normal Flow:** Every block-level element appears in a new line.
* **Relative Positioning:** Moves the element from where it would have been in normal flow.
* **Absolute Positioning:** Positions the element in relation to its containing element. It moves as the user scrolls up or down.
* **Fixed Positioning:** Similar to absolute positioning but positions the element in relation to the browser window instead. It does not move when the user scrolls up or down.
* **Floating Elements:** Takes element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of the a containing box.
* **z-index:** Helps with overlapping elements. We use it to control what elements sit on top of others.

*We often use the `<div>` element as a containing element to group together sections of a page.*

>TYPES OF LAYOUTS

1. **Fixed Width Layouts:** These type of designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
2. **Liquid Layouts:** These designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
3. **Grids:** Designs a grid structure to help position items on a page.

*Most designers keep pages between 960-1000 pixels wide and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels.*
