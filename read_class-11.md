# Mongo and Mongoose

We are starting our next module in the course. We are going to be working on a new project called Can of Books. This topic matters as it relates to learning how to use MondgoDB since we are going to implementing it in our app.

## nosql vs sql

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

  **SQL:**

  1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
  2. SQL databases are table based databases.
  3. SQL databases have predefined schema.
  4. SQL databases are vertically scalable.
  5. SQL databases uses SQL (Structured Query Language ) for defining and manipulating the data.

  **NoSQL:**

  1. NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
  2. NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
  3. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
  4. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
  5. NoSQL database queries are focused on collection of documents called UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Complex query intensive environment.

**Give a real world example.**

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

**Give a real world example.**

MongoDB

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL databases are vertically scalable. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

## sql vs nosql (Video)

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language.

**What is a relational database?**

Is a data base that works with certain assumptions that supports the SQL.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Tables.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

The strict requirements of the data with store in our data base tables. It is defined by fields.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

It is data base built to store lots of data in a very efficient way.

**How does it work?**

It works with collections instead of tables.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Inside the collections there are documents. Similar to JSON syntax. No schema.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB is more flexible because it ensures high and diverse data availability.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Sometimes we can have duplicate data.
