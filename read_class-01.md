## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a component?**

  A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation exporting it as a higher-level interface. It is a software object, intended to interact with other components. It can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**

* **Reusability:** Can be reused in different situations or applications.

* **Replaceable:** Can be substituted with other similar components.

* **Not context specific:** Designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* **Extensible:** Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* **Encapsulated:** Depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* **Independent:** Designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

* **Ease of deployment:** Easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

* **Reduced cost:** The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

* **Ease of development:** Their well-known interfaces and defined functionality allows development without impacting other parts of the system.

* **Reusable:** Can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

* **Modification of technical complexity:** Modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

* **Reliability:** The reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

* **System maintenance and evolution:** Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

* **Independent:** Flexible connectivity and independent development of components by different groups in parallel increasing productivity.

## Props & React

> React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate and the way to pass data between them is by using props.

**What is props short for?**

Short for **properties.** Special keyword used in react

**How are props used in React?**

1. We define an attribute and its value.
2. We pass it to a child component using Props. Like function arguments.
3. We render the Props Data.

**What is the flow of props?**

Uni-directional. One way parent, to child. Read Only.
