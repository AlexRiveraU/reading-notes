# JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages and many non-browser environments. It enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and many other functions. (Not to be confused with the Java programming language)

## How do you add JavaScript to your page?

JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses < link > elements to apply external stylesheets and < style > elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the < script > element.

## Variables

Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.

## HOW COMPUTERS WORK?

> WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER A COMPUTER

1. **INPUT:** Telling a computer what to do. Takes in the information.
2. **STORAGE:** Stores information as data in memory.
3. **PROCESSING:** Processor takes data from memory and changes it using algorithm (series of commands) sends processed data back to be stored in memory again until is ready to be output.
4. **OUTPUT** The display of the processed data depending on what the computer is designed for.
    * Text
    * Photos
    * Videos
    * Games
    * Virtual Reality
    * Robots

## BINARY SYSTEM & DATA

Through wires and circuits computers carry all the data in electrical signals. Wires turn ON and OFF using the binary system. This process is what we know as [bit.](https://techterms.com/definition/bit) All the information processed using the binary system are numbers converted into the output.

## HARDWARE, SOFTWARE & OS

* Hardware and Software interact with each through a CPU (Central Processing Unit)
* Software is created using programming languages
* OS (Operating System) is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
