## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

Engaged collaboration and Learning from fellow students. The few times that I had a chance to pair program I definitely felt more focused on the code than if I was working alone, it also gave me to opportunity to learn different approaches to problem solving by collaborating with my teammates.

**How does pair programming work?**

It involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing, the only one writing code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer, should not be writing any code.
