# WIREFRAME, HTML & SEMANTICS

## What is a Wireframe?

Wireframing is a practice used by UX (User Experience) designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. Think of it like some sort of sketch.

* **Pen and Paper:** Wireframes can be drawn with just pen and paper, which makes it very easy to change.

* **Wireframing Software:** There are many software options out there to create wireframes, like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/home) or [Balsamiq.](https://balsamiq.com/)

> Three key principles to wireframe

1. _Clarity_
2. _Confidence_
3. _Simplicity is key_
