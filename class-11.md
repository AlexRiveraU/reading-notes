## CSS IMAGES

We use CSS to control the size and alignment of images.

* **Size:** We use the `width` and `height` properties.
* **Alignment:** We use the `float` property.
* **Centering:** Images are inline elements by default. We `display` with the value `block`.
* **Background Images:** There are a few properties we can use:
  * `background-image` Places image behind any html element.
  * `background-repeat` Image is repeated horizontally or vertically.
  * `background-attachment` Specifies if image should stay in position or move as the user scrolls.
  * `background-position` Specifies where in the browser window should be placed.
  * `background` Shorthand for all the other background properties.
* **Rollover:** Changes buttons to a second style when user moves the mouse over it.

> HTML Video & Audio

The html elements for embedding these type of media documents are `<audio>` and `<video>`. There are many ways to utilize them within an html file. It is now convention to use third party hosting services like youTube or Vimeo for this purpose. It allows us to free storage from our site.
