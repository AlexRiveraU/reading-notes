## WHAT IS AN IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is basically a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. Think of it like Microsoft Outlook, that is an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package.
