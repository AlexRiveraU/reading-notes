# VERSION CONTROL

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### Distributed Version Control System

A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) creates mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on a server to replace any lost information, allowing programmers working in teams to collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project.

# GIT 

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

> Git Files States

* **Committed:** Data is securely stored in a local database
* **Modified:** File has been changed but not committed to the database
* **Staged:** Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
