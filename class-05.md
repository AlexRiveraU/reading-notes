## HTML IMAGES

For images we use the `<img>` tag. It is an empty element, does not need a closing tag. We also use the attributes `src` `alt` and `title`. (e.g)

`<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial." />`

***It is recommended to save images at the size they will be used.***

>Three rules for creating images:

1. Save them in the right format.
2. Save them at the right size.
3. Measure images in pixels.

>JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

* **JPEG:** For photos where the variation in color and intensity is smooth.
* **PNG:** For images with text or objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
* **GIF:** For images with animations.

`<figure>`  and `<figcaption>` elements are used to add captions to the images.

## CSS COLOR

Different ways to specify color values in CSS:

* **RGB VALUES:** Colors in terms of how much Red, Green and Blue is used. (e.g.)
rgb(100.100.90)
* **HEX CODES:** Six digit codes that represent how much Red, Green and Blue are in a color.(e.g) #ee3e80
* **COLOR NAMES:** Predefined colors. There are 147 color names recognized by browsers.
* **HSL COLOR:** Color determined based on their Hue, Saturation and Lightness values.(e.g.)
hsl(0, 0%, 78%)

***Alpha:*** *Extra value added for opacity in RBG or HSL. (e.g) RBGA, HSLA*

`color`: Specifies the color of text inside an element

`background-color`: Sets the color of the background of a box.

## TEXT

### CHOOSING A TYPEFACE

* **Serif:** Have extra details on the end.
* **Sans-Serif:** Have straight ends.
* **Monospace:** Every letter has the same width.
* **Cursive:** Have characteristics like handwriting style.
* **Fantasy:** They are usually decorative fonts often used for titles.

There are different properties to control weight, style and spacing.

**Units of type size:**  Pixels(px), Percentages(%) and EMS(em)

*The space between lines of text, letters and words can be adjusted.*

*Text can be aligned to the left, right, center or justified. It can also be intended.*
