## HTML TABLES

Tables are various types of information that need to be displayed in a grid format. Like a spreadsheet.

>KEY ELEMENTS FOR CREATING TABLES

* `<table>` Adds tables to the page.
* `<tr>` Creates each row on the table.
* `<td>` Creates the cell inside a row.
* `<th>` Creates a heading cell inside a row.

We cab also use `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` to create long tables.

## JAVASCRIPT

### OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

We use a combination of `new` keyword and the `Object()` constructors function (e.g)

`let hotel = new Object();`

To update the value of properties we use dot notation. (e.g)

`hotel.name = 'Park';`

>KEYWORD *THIS*

It is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the functions is declared alters what it means. It refers to one object, usually the one where in which the functions operates.

* **Functions in global scope:** When they are created at the top level of the script. Not inside an object. It's also called **global context.**
* **Global variables:** Can also become properties of the window object. When a function is the global context you can access global variables.

## STORING DATA

Data is represented using name/value pairs. We use **Arrays** or **Objects** to group a set of related values.

* **Variables:** Have just one key and one value. (e.g)

`let hotel = 'Park'`

* **Arrays:** Can store multiple pieces of information (e.g)

`Let hotels = ['Quay' 'Park' 'Beach']`
